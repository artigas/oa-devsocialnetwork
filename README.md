# DevSocialNetwork by artigas
Hi, my name is Manuel Artigas. I'm a Back End developer and this is my solution to the OA .NET code challenge. The statement for this challenge is:

> A bunch of enthusiasts inside a company decided to create an
> on-premise social network for developers. They choose .NET 6 as a
> platform for the API development. Unfortunately all front-end
> developers are too busy this month, so for the time being backend
> developers can only work on API that will do minimum valuable product in the future.
